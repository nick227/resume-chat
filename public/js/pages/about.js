<h2>Nick</h2>
<h6>Austin, TX</h6>
<p>
At this stage of my career, I’m looking for a role where I can materially influence technical direction and product outcomes. I bring deep hands-on experience, strong execution bias, and the ability to turn complex ideas into maintainable systems.

    <p>
For the last 20 years, I’ve worked in senior engineering roles at the cross-point between teams and departments. I specialize in breaking through silos and shipping systems that move the business. I’ve delivered three large-scale platforms, dozens of mid-sized systems, and a long tail of production features all <i>without</i> AI. Since 2022, I have been building RAG systems, agent-based pipelines, and automation for content generation, code development, and testing.
